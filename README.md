I decided to set up this project to learn JavaScript language internals, trying to work out something useful.

Often i get asked to do a very simple website or a really non-complex web-appish stuff with the deadline set to 'yesterday'. For such projects i don't need the cross-browser giants like jQuery, i just need a few things. The most common are:

 - PubSub //pending
 - AJAX Wrapper //still missing
 - on() for events //done
 - adding wrappers for selectors api //pending

The list above might grow with time, but doesn't have to, depending on my needs. If You feel You can make a use of it, or, even better, take the code and make it better, feel free to grab it and/or fork it as many times as You wish.
